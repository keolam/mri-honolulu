            <h1>Tips from MRI Network Recruiters</h1>

            <p className="objective">
                MRI's recruiters have highlighted 12 of the career accomplishments that most interest employers.
                It's possible that you've accomplished some of these in your current jobâ€”think of how you might
                include them on your resume. Approach each one from the viewpoint of a recruiter: How can this
                past accomplishment benefit a potential employer?
